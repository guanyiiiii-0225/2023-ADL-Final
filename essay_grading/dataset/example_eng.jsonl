Some students find a part-time job because they want to help their parents. Their family's financial situation forces them to do so. They have to work in order to reduce their parents' burden on their tuition or other expenses. \nOther students take up a part-time job not because of their family's financial situation, but because they need money to buy things they want, such as basketball shoes, smart phones, or luxury products. Their parents may think these aren't necessary things, but they want to buy them. So, they find a part-time job. \nStill, others take on part-time jobs for the sake of increasing their social experiences. They want to get in touch with society earlier and can learn a lot of things while working, such as how to interact with customers, bosses, and colleagues, and how to deal with tricky problems they encounter at work. n\nAs for me, I want to have a part-time job too. My reason aligns with the third one mentioned in the previous paragraph. I want to increase my social experiences instead of living under my parents' protection since childhood.\nI don't know how to interact with strangers, and I don't know what I will encounter when I am a society freshman. My family and schools are so warm-hearted that it makes me unaware of how different the real society can be. When you are protected, you feel secure. However, once you become independent, you might experience different feelings and you won't be neglected. \nTeachers and parents always tell us about the differences between school, family, and society. I won't be protected by my parents my whole life. The earlier I step out and get acquainted with society, the better off I will be. As a result, I would like to have a part-time job in order to adapt to society earlier and gain more experiences.","output": "Content (out of 5 points): Score: 5 Comment: The theme of the essay is clear, and it provides specific and complete details for support.

One of the reasons students work part-time is to earn some money during vacations or after school so that they have enough \"pocket money\" to buy things they want. Some senior high students even earn money to buy the latest cellphones and fashionable shoes by working part-time. \nThe second reason is that some students prefer working part-time to studying. They believe they can learn skills that are more meaningful than what they can gain from just studying. \nIf I were to work part-time, my reason would be to learn skills that books and teachers cannot impart. I want to become a humble, passionate, and responsible person through working. Besides, it would be the first income I earn. I would learn that it's not easy to earn money, so I will cherish the things I own.","output": "Content (out of 5 points):\nScore: 3\nComment: The theme of the essay is clear, but some details are rather simplistic.
