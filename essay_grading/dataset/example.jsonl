Some students find a part-time job because they want to help their parents. Their family's financial situation forces them to do so. They have to work in order to reduce their parents' burden on their tuition or other expenses. \nOther students take up a part-time job not because of their family's financial situation, but because they need money to buy things they want, such as basketball shoes, smart phones, or luxury products. Their parents may think these aren't necessary things, but they want to buy them. So, they find a part-time job. \nStill, others take on part-time jobs for the sake of increasing their social experiences. They want to get in touch with society earlier and can learn a lot of things while working, such as how to interact with customers, bosses, and colleagues, and how to deal with tricky problems they encounter at work. n\nAs for me, I want to have a part-time job too. My reason aligns with the third one mentioned in the previous paragraph. I want to increase my social experiences instead of living under my parents' protection since childhood.\nI don't know how to interact with strangers, and I don't know what I will encounter when I am a society freshman. My family and schools are so warm-hearted that it makes me unaware of how different the real society can be. When you are protected, you feel secure. However, once you become independent, you might experience different feelings and you won't be neglected. \nTeachers and parents always tell us about the differences between school, family, and society. I won't be protected by my parents my whole life. The earlier I step out and get acquainted with society, the better off I will be. As a result, I would like to have a part-time job in order to adapt to society earlier and gain more experiences.","output": "內容 (滿分 5 分):\n分數: 5\n評語: 作文主題清楚，並提供了具體和完整的細節來支持。作者清楚地說明了學生為何會選擇打工的原因，也很好地表述了自己打工的理由。\n組織 (滿分 5 分):\n分數: 5\n評語: 這篇文章有明確的開頭、中段發展以及結尾。作者將各種學生打工的原因逐一列出，從而形成了清晰的段落和主題。\n文法、句構 (滿分 4 分):\n分數: 4\n評語: 文章文法正確，句子結構有變化，表達清晰流暢。\n字彙、拼字 (滿分 4 分):\n分數: 4\n評語: 作文的詞彙運用恰當，拼寫正確，且未出現重複使用的詞彙。\n體例 (滿分 2 分):\n分數: 2\n評語: 作文的格式、標點和大小寫正確，符合英文作文的標準。\n總分: 20分 總評: 這是一篇優秀的英文作文，主題明確，組織結構清晰，詞彙豐富，文法正確，遵循了合適的寫作體例。作者成功地回答了兩個問題，且提供了具體細節來支持其觀點。"}

One of the reasons students work part-time is to earn some money during vacations or after school so that they have enough \"pocket money\" to buy things they want. Some senior high students even earn money to buy the latest cellphones and fashionable shoes by working part-time. \nThe second reason is that some students prefer working part-time to studying. They believe they can learn skills that are more meaningful than what they can gain from just studying. \nIf I were to work part-time, my reason would be to learn skills that books and teachers cannot impart. I want to become a humble, passionate, and responsible person through working. Besides, it would be the first income I earn. I would learn that it's not easy to earn money, so I will cherish the things I own.","output": "內容 (滿分 5 分):\n分數: 3\n評語: 文章主題明確，但有些細節較為簡單。作家提到學生打工的兩種原因，並說明了自己會選擇打工的原因。\n組織 (滿分 5 分):\n分數: 3\n評語: 文章的組織結構清晰，有開頭，主體和結尾。不過，第二段的理由可能需要更深入的解釋和支持。\n文法、句構 (滿分 4 分):\n分數: 2\n評語: 文中的文法和句構基本正確，但有些地方的語句稍微不夠流暢。\n字彙、拼字 (滿分 4 分):\n分數: 2\n評語: 文章中的詞彙選擇和拼寫大致正確，不過部分句子的詞彙選擇可以更豐富。\n體例 (滿分 2 分):\n分數: 2\n評語: 作文的格式、標點和大小寫均正確，符合英文作文的標準。\n總分: 12分 總評: 這是一篇不錯的英文作文，主題明確，但在細節的描述上可以進一步豐富。作者的組織結構清晰，但第二段的理由可能需要更深入的闡釋。文法和句構大致正確，但有些地方的語句稍不流暢。字彙選擇和拼寫大都正確，但部分句子可以使用更豐富的詞彙。格式和標點使用恰當。"}
