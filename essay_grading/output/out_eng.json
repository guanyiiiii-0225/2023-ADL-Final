		"content": "As a Taiwanese, there are two things that I take pride in. One is our local cuisine, and another is the magnificent scenery. I have traveled to many countries and tasted a wide variety of foods. Although each kind of cuisine forms distinctive and delicious aftertastes, the most preferable food in mind will always be those sold in night markets in Taiwan. The taste and smell are not the only aspects I missed, but also the atmosphere. Instead of dining in a luxurious restaurant with delicate utensils, bustling through the streets while grabbing a pig blood cake and interacting with friends along the way is what I love the most. Besides the atmosphere, the tradition of Taiwanese food is what I am proud of too. Many of them had their origins hundreds of years ago when our ancestors first approached this island. They reinvented the foods they were familiar with to adapt to the lifestyle here. The culture and the efforts the ancestors made behind Taiwanese cuisines are of significance.\nApart from foods, I've been to numerous well-known landmarks around the world. I thought that I would be amazed by the landscapes in Taiwan after visiting the renowned places. But I was totally wrong. The mountains and valleys are always breathtaking, and I often wonder how such a small island in such a big world has such stunning scenery. The rivers streaming down cut through enormous rocks like magic. I feel proud to be calling this place home.\nIt's a shame that there is so much to explore in Taiwan, but we don't catch the world's attention. I suppose that making more films and shows related to Taiwanese culture can draw foreigners to experience it. Just as the Koreans do, we should put more emphasis on advertising such things we are proud of through the internet or television since the entire world is connected by technology. Another effective measure I suggest is holding more international events or competitions. We can have competitions for local foods that foreign cooks might be interested in participating in, or even adventurous races like the Taroko Valley biking race. The race attracts bikers each year, and some even decide to stay in Taiwan because of the unique experience. We should broadcast these events and let the world learn more about our homeland.\nIt dawned on me that we must introduce our two irreplaceable features to others while traveling to other countries, and I hope that in the near future, I can greet more foreigners here and proudly say, \"Welcome to my home, Taiwan!\"",

		"content": "Taiwan is an island full of surprises. From marvelous natural scenery to the charming diverse cultures of the warm-hearted residents, these elements make up the brightest stars in the constellation of infinite charms. Among all, I feel very proud of our country's natural beauty and the cultures. Tiny as the island may be, it is home to a variety of vegetation and animals. Besides, with mountains reaching altitudes of up to 3000 meters, emerald plains scattered on the west coast, and glittering oceans surrounding the island, it offers a gateway car for us to escape the city's hustle and bustle. In addition, the fertile aboriginal culture, Chinese culture, and Japanese culture make Taiwan the land to cultivate all kinds of ethnic groups, enabling it to stand out from all.\nTo pave the way for Taiwan to be more recognized internationally, there are two essential considerations. Initially, due to the accessibility of the Internet, Taiwan's government should upload videos or advertisements to widely used social platforms or YouTube to shed light on our country's beauty. For example, the snow-capped Mt. Jade, the train ride in the forest of Ali Mountain, or the canoe ride beneath the canopy of leaves in Tainan can all be included in the video clip. Secondly, Taiwan can collaborate with singers or music groups to promote our impressive cultures via their music videos or concerts. For instance, in the video promoting the album of the British music group Clean Bandit, shot in Taiwan, they present Taiwan's temples and traditional dances to the audience. It is no exaggeration to say that with these methods, I believe that the vibrant shades of Taiwan will be spread to every corner of the world.",
