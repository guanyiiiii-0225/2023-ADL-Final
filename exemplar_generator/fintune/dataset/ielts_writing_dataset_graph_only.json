From its core branches out many small nerves called dendrites with the role of receving messages from other cells. The acquired messages are passed away from the cell body to other neurons, muscles or glands through a chain of axon. Each axon is coverred by a small element called myelin sheath that helps speed up the neural impulses.\nThe message transmission process is conducted by continous actions of each component. After the dendrites receive information, the cell body will trigger an electrical signal traveling down the axon chain carrying these messages to a destination consisting of a network off terminal buttons. Each button form junction with other dendrite other cells to connect the messages. After all, all neuron are connected to form a network.",

Nearby buildings can be built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater as well as the water passing through the floodgate beneath the stopbank, resulting in an area of \u2018internal ponding.\u2019\nIf it had not been a stopbank, as described in the second diagram, there would have been nothing to stop the river from flooding. In this case, the solution is to put homes on stilts much higher than the one in the first picture. The height of the stilts is measured to ensure that the floor of the house is three hundred meters above the 100-year-flood level regardless of how deep the water area is under the house. This measure is called the \u2018freeboard.\u2019",

Then, the steam is conducted by a pipe to another cistern, where aromatic plants are added, in order to obtain oil vapor mixed with steam.\nRight afterward, the mixture goes into a pipe system, where a condensation process takes place, thanks to a condenser that uses cold water. In doing so, the cold water flowing in the condenser absorbs the heat that comes from the pipe where the oil and water solution is.

As it is charted out, the oil participates in around 50% of the process, starting from step 4 to step 9.\nThe process begins in steps 1, 2 and 3 with heating water till evaporation, so steam forms. This steam then flows through the aromatic plants gathering oil in form of vapor in step 4. Within the 5th step, the vaporized oil along with the preformed steam migrate together and move to the cooling step. In the condenser, 3 different steps cooperate for the process to continue. From step 6, cold water joins the system to help in the condensation process of both the steam and the oil vapor. In the 7th step, the heated water through cooling of the flowen mixture escapes out of the process. Both steps together, promotes reaching step 8, in which the water mixed with essential oil is formed.\nWithin the separator, the essential oil is derived from the preformed mixture and this allocates in step 10 the aromatic water and accordingly in step 9 the essential oil.",

It consists of a fibrous top surface, a layer of dry concrete, and a waterproof layer. The features of each layer play different roles in later usage in terms of ductility and stability. The finished product of the concrete canvas is then packaged in boxes and delivered by truck to the construction site, where the boxes are unwrapped, and the canvas inside is taken out.\nIn the next stage, the concrete canvas is spread by means of a rope drawn by a vehicle. In order to fix the canvas on the ground, pegs are used and hammered every ten meters along each side of the canvas. After that, on one end of the spread canvas, a door is installed as the entrance of the storage. The covered space between the canvas and the underground is then pumped up and expanded with the aid of a blower machine. Following that, water is sprinkled over the surface of the swollen canvas and reacted with dry concrete with the aim of generating a hard shell for storage. Thus, the form of storage is constructed. After a set period of around 20 to 24 hours, the storage can be put into use.",

In fact, it was double of America's, as it meant 60 PPM in China. However, although China showed again the highest level of transport pollution with 70 PPM, America was not very far from that figure as it was just under 60 PPM, while Japan was half, and Australia did not even reach 20 PPM.\nFinally, industry pollution in China was even bigger than the other areas, as it reached the highest point with 80 PPM. However, even though Japan was largely behind America and China in terms of electricity and transport pollution, it was the second country of indutry pollution, but it was roughly half of China's. America was under that with just under 30 PPM, and Australia displayed even less than that slightly under 20 PPM.\nTo conclude, China is clearly the country that demonstrated the highest levels of pollution in each given areas, even though America was close to their level of transport pollution at that time.

        "answer": "The pictures give information about two ways of protecting houses from flooding. Overall, the houses or buildings are constructed on stamps.\nThe first way of protecting buildings from floods it to make them far away from the water and not to close to the hill or mountain to avoid any water coming down. Additionally, the stopbank should be place close to the water as a protection wall. At the bottom of the stopbank a floodgate is allocated so that water can pass to the internal pond underneath the house without touching it and a bem is situated to the water side which can open and close depending on the water level.\nThe second diagram does not have a stopbank and the house is positioned closer to the water. The house is built on higher stamps, so that the water can flow underneath it. Between house and water, a freeboard of around 300mm can be found where no water should be, so that the house remains dry.",

        "answer": "The diagrams show the way in which the flooding of houses may be prevented by constructing them upon raised foundations, so that the floor of the house is separated from the highest probable water level (considering a period of 100 years) by at least 300 millimeters (30 centimeters). This distance is called \"freeboard.\"\nThe first diagram shows how this may be accomplished in situations in which the house is located between a stopbank -that is, a barrier separating the river or drain from the area in which the house is located- and a hill or otherwise elevated area from which rainwater may run downhill (a phenomenon known as \"internal runoff\"), potentially creating a pond in the area in which the house stands. In such a situation, the diagram shows that the stopbank should be higher than the 100-year flood level, although it does not show the minimum clearance required. At the same time, the house should be high enough that its floor is at least 300 millimeters above the 100-year ponding level.\nThe second diagram shows the way in which the house should be protected from floods in situations where there is no stopbank. In such cases, the house should simply be raised to a height at least 300 millimeters above the 100-year flood level. The second diagram does not show the effects of any internal runoff.\nBoth diagrams provide for a common solution, which is to have a minimum freeboard of 300 millimeters between the bottom of the house and the highest probable water level, be it the 100-year flood level or the 100-year ponding level.",

Houses can be built lower in areas with a stopbank.\nIt is clearly shown in the diagram that house floor level in areas without a stopbank must be 300 millimeters above the 100-year flood or ponding level. However, house floor level in areas with a stopbank can be much lower, even under the 100-year flood level. This might result from the fact that the stopbank is high enough to stop water from flooding in.\nAt the same time, the floodgate and berm under the stopbank connect the internal pond with the river outside. When the internal runoff leads to too much water on land, People can open the floodgate and let the water out into the river or drain.",

The whole process takes a few minutes of active time to produce and some passive time to let the dough rest.\nThe ingredients required are as follows: four cups of 2000 grams of type '00' flour, one and a half cups or 325 grams of water, 2 teaspoons of salt and half a teaspoon of dry active yeast. They are first put into a stand mixer, mixed on slow speed for two minutes, then again on moderate speed for five minutes. For the last two minutes, the dough is mixed on slow speed.\nAfter the mixing procedure, the dough is left to rise for at least two hours, until it is doubled in size. This is occurring as the yeast in it absorbs all the sugar and converts into carbon dioxide, which is a gas trapped in the dough. Afterwards, we deflate it in order to get rid of all the air inside. Finally, the dough is cut into three equal pieces and they are ready to be made into delicious pizza.",

This is apparently refer to the need a lot of spending because the families were bigger than today. While the transportation and the others' cash is considered much the least between the whole needs.\nIn 2010, there is a big change in the whole life style which truly impact on families and their ways of spending money. First of all, buying food is quite important as original source for people energy, it has taken the largest amount in exactly 34%.And because many wives become worker, the need to buy ready meals become more necessary than before. Also, it is clear that transportation is almost nearly equal.\nAs to what has shown there is rapidly decreasing in housing's spending in 2010,and this is justified by the completely change of life in using less and simple thing instead of using expensive and too much staff, and also select smaller house rather than bigger ones. Moreover most families prefer to spend money on their pleasure and joyful life. It is noticed that other spending has jumped sharply from 4% to 19.2% which means people are turning to be consumers. Finally there is no doubt that education has less priority in both dates.\nTo sum up, we could say that the amount of expenditures in a country in 1950 and 2010 has differed according to the lifestyle of each family.",

The use of hand sanitizers has been one of them, but what is it made of? Ethanol is a common disinfecting agent found in cleaning products, which originates from corn. Here's a nine-step manufacturing method of how this alcohol is produced from that supercrop.\nIn the first third of production, the maize is harvested, stored and ground up during milling. First, farmers collect ripened ears from fields, and then place them in bins and other containers. These are then crushed into a powder to increase the surface area, hence increasing the potential yield of ethanol created.\nSteps four to six involve boiling, brewing and filtration. The powder produced in the milling process is mixed with water and boiling takes four hours. Once it is done, the mixtue is left to stand for 48 hours, allowing fermentation to occur, and unprocessed ethanol be created. After this two-day step, the mixture is filtered to separate the unpurified ethanol from the solid by-product.\nLastly, the liquid raw product is distilled, packaged in various containers and shipped to retailers. Filtration is carried out for five hours to increase the purity of the ethanol. Afterwards, the final product is packaged and stored until it is transported to stores, where we can purchase it for our daily use and protection.\nMany important people such as farmers, scientist and transporters assist in the manufacturing process of ethanol and we thank them for creating this essential product.",

During the cooking process, water is maintained at a certain level to ensure that the corn is always submerged in water while boiling.\nThe cooked corn is then fermented for at least 48 hours. This is to prepare it for separation of solid by-products and the liquid drawn from the cooked and fermented corn.The solid by-product is dried to be used for other products like chuka, a cornflake-like snack eaten by children. However, the liquid is further purified into ethanol. The prosess of purifying the liquid into ethanol takes about 5 hours.

        "answer": "The bar praph demonstrates the percentage of the total world population in four major countries in 1950 and 2002, and estimation for 2050. Overall, China and india constitute the largest portion in every period. However, while the percentage of the total world population in India increase over time, the percentages of every other countries including China decrease.\nFirstly, in 1950, China had the largest portion in world population. It took 23% of world population, while India took 15%. USA and Japan have considerable percentage as well, which was 7% and 4% repectively.\nAs time passed by, in 2002, India's percentage rised up to 17% while China's percentage decreased to 20%. Meanwhile, USA experienced severe loss and reached to 5%, and Japan's portion decreased to 3%\nLastly, in 2050, It is estimated that India will have the largest portion in world populartion. It will reach to 18%, while China's ratio will decrease to 15%. On the other hand, USA's percentage will remain same as 2002, while the percentage of Japan shrink to 1% of the total world population.\nIn summary, India and China have the largest population in all periods, while the percentage of India is expected to surpass that of China in 2050. USA have relatively similar percentages in the three periods, around 5%, while Japan's ratio will shrink from 4% to 1% in 2050.",

As we can see, there are 4 main branches and each of them describes a certain issue, caused by deforestation.\nAccording to the first branch from the left, forest destruction can lead to the state when soil becomes hard and \"baked\". It occurs due to the fact that heavy logging equipment compresses the soil, as the first block of the chart says. Because soil becomes \"baked\", rain water starts to run off which causes flooding.\nIf we look at the remaining branches, we can see that they all lead to the same conclusion - less biodiversity. But there are three different reasons for it. The first one is soil erosion. When we cut the trees, we have fewer tree roots to support the topsoil that eventually erodes.\nThe second reason - increased risk of burning. It is followed by the destruction of waste wood. Then we have some micro-organisms such as pioneer species that move in and initiate degradation of vegetation. And it's all resulted in less biodiversity.\nThe last branch starts with the fact that after cutting forests we have less plants to give back moisture to air, so less moisture enters the air. This triggers less precipitation, and so, increased droughts. Plants that unable to withstand hot and dry weather die and it ends with less biodiversity.\nTo conclude everything, the main purpose of the presented flow chart was to demonstrate the severe damage that could be caused by deforestation.",

        "answer": "The illustration shows the present water consevation and distribution system in australia.In this aticle we will cover the present water distribution supply in details and make observations which will make the system more effective for future applications.\nThis section provides details on the present water supply system. Present water supply system consists of a dam which is used to store the water which is collected from rains.Once the dams are filled with water the pure water is supplied to household, factories and the cities for use. The waste water from the commecial sectors is sent to water treatment plant for treatment.Any water from the storms is supplied to the rivers.\nAlthough supply system is a comprehensive water supply and storage system the storm water released into the rivers is not treated to ensure clean water is being released, this could lead to pollution of the rivers.Dams are generally built to hold the river water and collect rain water but it seems the dam is independent of the river, hence building a dam along the river would allow australia to have a better supply of water.Also, the treated waste water can be supplied back for commercial use or released into the river.\nThe present water supply system is effective and makes good use of the water ensuring ample availibilty to the country, a few issues can be pointed out which if corrected for the future could lead to this being a more complete water supply system and providing its residents and businesses bettter supply of water.",

        "answer": "The table outlines the past, present, and future consumption of five types of fast food. Comparing the consumption in 2005 with the present level, it is clear that all consumptios of fast food has increased since 2005 except for the hamburger. While this trend suggests that hamburger consumption is in decline, projected consumption in 2025 shows that burgers would gain renewed interest.\nMoving the attention away from hamburgers, we can see that the increase in salad consumption is more drastic than that of other fast food categories. Specifically, the predicted increase in fried chicken consumption is 10 units, which is outshadowed by the 36-unit increase for salad. This suggests that, while more fast food will be consumed overall, the general public is shifting towards healthier options.\nFinally, although the consumption for hamburger, friedn chicken, and salad all increased significantly, figures for fried rice and noodles remained stagnant. This suggests that both fried rice and noodles are less welcomed by the consumers compared to other fast food.",

        "answer": "The diagram displays the general principles of how electricity is generated in a dam. In general, to produce hydroenergy, there should be a difference in the level of water flowing through the turbine.\nThe water is stored in the reservoir out of which it goes through the intake to the penstrock. The pens should be inclined. This means that its high point is in the intake and then it goes down to the turbine. The pressure, that the flow creates, makes the turbin roll and start the generator. Generator produces power that is supplied to the long distance power lines.\nHaving passed throuth the turbine, water, in its turn, sharply goes down and falls into the river.\nAs it can be seen from the diagram, the generator and long distance power lines are located on the ground while there parts of the dam, such as the intake, the penstock, and the turbine are all under the ground.",

The second step is cutting and spraying this material with a fire retardant. After that, a circuit-board material should be cleaned and delivered to another sector of production. According to the data, automated IC attachment and soldering are being used in this sector. The next step is checking on visual and quality disadvantages. In case circuit boards do not have defects, they are finally tested, packaged, and delivered to factories.

Whereas the lowest expenditure on fast foods is pizza approximately 6 pounds a week. In the volume of consumption, there is a rapid rise on fish & chips sales over the period contrary to a continuous reduction on pizza spending in the decades.\nTo start with the fast-food spending, hamburgers is the highest sales of fast foods per week in the U.K. In the high and average incomes classes, the amount of hamburger sales are the top one in their spending on fast foods, 45 pounds and around 32 pounds a week respectively. Fish & chips spending in the high-income group hits around 16 pounds a week, compared with the spending on pizza almost 19 pounds a week. This is followed by average income classes whose weekly expenditures on fish & chips and pizza are 25 pounds and around 12 pounds individually. Conversely, those with lower income spend much on fish & chips approximately 16 pound a week which is the top one of their fast food costs, compared with hamburgers and pizza which are around 14 pounds and 6 pounds a week.\nGoing into more detail with regard to the fast-food consumption in gram, there was not significate increase on fish & chips spending in the start of the period.

Luxemburg teachers reach the highest starting salary, equal to 80,000. Instead, in Australia, there are the least paid teachers, they have less than 30,000 per year.

        "answer": "The table gives information about the salaries of secondary school teachers in different countries in 2009. The main differences between the countries are two. First, a discrepancy concerns the starting salary of teachers. Second, there is a gap in the years that teachers need to teach before obtaining the maximum salary.\nOn the one hand, the starting salaries of teachers in the selected countries are slightly different. Luxemburg teachers reach the highest starting salary, equal to 80,000. Instead, in Australia, there are the least paid teachers, they have less than 30,000 per year. There is an enormous discrepancy between Luxemburg, in which the starting salaries are the highest ones, and the other countries. Although Denmark is the second country in giving higher salaries, the money teachers reach the first years of teaching is 45.000.\nOn the other hand, another discrepancy concerns the years that a teacher has to teach before reaching the maximum salary. Indeed, despite being the least-paid teachers, Australians obtain the maximum salary after 9 years of teaching and obtain 48.000 per year. Instead, Luxemburg requires 30 years of work to give teachers the maximum salary, which is also the highest among the countries, and corresponds to 130.000. Denmark is the country in which high-school teachers obtain the maximum salary in just 8 years. On the completely opposite side, Japan teachers have to teach for at least 37 years before obtaining the highest salary.",

Those were measured by British thermal Units.\nBy and large, the consumption and production of energy in the U.S.A. grew strongly over the period from 35 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to approximately 90 quadrillion Btu in 2000 and from 25 quadrillion Btu in 1950 to 65 quadrillion Btu in 2000 respectively. There are a prediction in energry consumption reaching 135 quadrillion Btu in 2025 and 75 quadrillion Btu in energy production.\nThe first detail to note is that the consumption and production of engery rose steadily over the period. They were significant fluctuation at the start of the period but had risen to around 50 quadrillion Btu in 1975. This was followed by the another fluctuation between 1975 and 2000 and recovered by nearly 90 quadrillion Btu in energy consumption in 2000 and 65 quadrillion Btu in energy production.\nThe amount of energy consumption in the United States is projected to remain much higher and will be increased as much as energy production overall.

After 2000 there is a huge boost of the number of graduate students.\nThere is a huge discrepacy between the number of female graduates and males one. Indeed, the number of males student is always lower than the number of females. This tendency is constant over all the years. In 1992 the number of males that obtain a degree is arount 70.000 while the number of females is arount 100.000. Since the number of graduates students increase over the years, in 2007 there are both more females and males that obtained the degree certification. Even in this case the number of girls is the highest. There are more almost 150.000 female graduate students. By contrast, the number of males, although it participates in the increasement process, remain lower.

        "answer": "The diagram illustrates the acid level in the mouth obtained afrer the consuption of sugar and honey. The process of incresment of acidity (or low pH values) are subjected to a strong variation in the 40 minutes occurring after sweet foods are eaten. The risk that a tooth decay occurs is high mostly if you eat cane sugar.\nBefore eating sweet foods the level of pH is neutral. 5 minutes after sugar has been eaten, the situation is radically different. The level of pH plummet down, around 3,5 if you eat cane sugare. After 5 minutes the level of pH arrives at the maximum of the acidity level that can be caused by sugar. Then, the level of pH starts deacreasing slowly again and after 30 minutes (if cane sugar had been eaten) or a little bit less (20-25 minutes) if honey or fruit sugar had been eaten, the acidity is almost normal (between 6 and 7).\nThe risk that a tooth decay occurs are very high, mostly if the the sweet product eaten is cane sugar. Instead, the possibility that a problem like tooth decay arise is very low if honey had been eaten. Specifically, the minutes under risk are just 15 if you had eaten honey and more that 30 if you had chosen cane sugar. A tooth decay can occur when the level of pH is lower that 5.5. Then, the acidity of honey remains always lower that that of cane sugar and for this reason the risky minutes are lower.",

Between Augest and September, the temperature levels out at about 28 degree. After that the temperature continues to decrease to about 21 degree. There is little difference between Janurary and December in temperature, but a slight growth.\nAs for the precipitation, from Janurary to May, the trend of increase is rather moderate, but it elevates in June from about 100mm to over 250mm. Then it continues to grow till July which the precipitation in Kalkata reaches its peak of almost 350mm. In the following month of July, there is only a little drop in precipitation and then in October, it drops sharply from about 380mm in September to only 150mm in October. Another sharp decrease occurs in November to only 20mm, and then the precipitation reachers the minimal point in December.",

When the temperature of Kolkata is not above 25 degrees, which it is during November to February, the precipitation appears to be under 50 millimetres whereas when it may seem to be between 27 and 30 degrees, the rainfall has a significant growth, namely more than 200 millimetres.\nHowever, it is not when there are the highest temperatures that the precipitation seems to have the same level as well, for instance, the highest heat may be depicted at 32 degrees whereas the rainfall appears only to be at 100 millimetres.

In general, the number of passengers increasingly rises and rapidly goes down during the day. Nonetheless, at lunchtime and at nighttime the numbers of passengers are almost stable.\nThe number of passengers during the day is subject to dramatic changes. Indeed, after 6 am the number of people taking the underground picks up passing from 100 people to 400. The passengers decrease immediately and in less than an hour there are just half of the passengers (almost 200). A specular situation happens during the afternoon. Indeed, the number of passengers at 4 pm is less than 100. They start to increase notably and in less than two hours (at 5 pm) there are almost 400 people in the station.\nAt lunchtime and nighttime, the number of underground passengers is almost stable. During the morning and the afternoon there are significant and radical changes, whereas the hours between 12 pm to 2 pm and between 8 pm to 10 pm are not subject to the same type of change. In particular, during lunchtime, the number of people who take the underground is almost 300 for a period longer than two hours. Similarly, the number of passengers after 8 pm moves around 150.",

The reason for this could be work, school, college, or university since they usually start early in the morning. There is a considerable decrease in passengers at four post meridiem, which is under one hundred people. The difference between the highest and lowest passenger rate is three hundred passengers, which is a massive spike as it is shown in the graph. It also shows that there are two huge spikes, one at eight in the morning, and the other at six post meridiem, which statistically means that many people are busy in between those times, maybe with school, university, college, work, whatever the citizens of England are busy with in between those two spikes. In conclusion, London has busy passengers, but mainly at eight in the morning, and six after midday.",

Two big differences between the metro in the different cities concern the length of the route and the yearly number of passengers. Although there are some underground railway systems that have been opened more recently, the oldest ones (London, Paris and Tokyo) are the most frequented and long.\nThere is a big difference concerning the length of km of underground railways systems. In London, that is the oldest metro system built in 1863, thereis the longest system, almost 400 km. Instead, Kyoto has the shortest metro system with just 11km of route. There is a huge discrepancy between the metro systems that have been built in Kyoto and Los Angeles. Although in these two cities the underground systems were built more recently, respectively in 1981 and 2001, they have the shortest systems. For instance in L.A. the route does not exceed 30km). There is at least a discrepancy of more than 100 km between the younger subways (Kyoto and Los Angeles) and the older ones. Indeed, Washington DC, that was built in 1927, is 126 km long.\nThe number of passenger per year is almost directly proportionate to the lenght of route. However there are some differences to be noted. Namely, the more frequented metro is that of Tokyo with 1927 million of passengers per year. Paris and London immediately follow the Japanaise capital (the numbers are respectively 1191 and 775 millions). Instead, Kyoto that is the metro with the shortest route is also the less used, with just 45 million of people who take it.",
