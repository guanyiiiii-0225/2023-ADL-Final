    example = "I agree with the trend of universities encouraging professors to teach professional courses in English. This approach has several benefits. Firstly, it exposes students to a broader range of academic literature and research, as English is the lingua franca of higher education. This helps students to develop a more nuanced understanding of their field and stay up-to-date with the latest developments. Secondly, teaching in English promotes a more diverse and inclusive learning environment, as students from different countries and backgrounds can participate and engage with the course materials more easily.\n\nIf I were to enroll in a future university where the required courses are taught in English, I would embrace this opportunity to improve my language skills and broaden my academic horizons. I would take advantage of resources such as language support services and peer mentorship programs to help me succeed in these courses. Additionally, I would actively seek out opportunities to engage with course materials and participate in class discussions, using my knowledge of English to contribute to the learning environment. Overall, I believe that teaching professional courses in English is a valuable approach that can enhance the academic experience for students from diverse backgrounds."
